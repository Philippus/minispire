## MiniSpire

MiniSpire is an extraction of core typeclasses/data types from the [Spire library](https://github.com/typelevel/spire), along with the relevant imports from [Algebra](https://github.com/typelevel/algebra/), [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) and [Machinist](https://github.com/typelevel/machinist).

It reflects roughly Spire 0.16.2 and cats-kernel/algebra around the 2.0.0 milestone.

It demonstrates the core architecture of Spire, is intended as a pedagogical device as well as a playground to port Spire for Scala 3.0.

In particular, only a subset of the typeclasses, data types are kept. Law checking and tests are absent.
